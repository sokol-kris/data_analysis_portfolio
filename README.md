# Kristina Melnikova - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Kristina! I have a technical background and a master's degree in "System Analysis and Management". During my studies, I worked closely with analysis and marketing as a procurement and pricing analyst, but now, thanks to mastering new tools, I am looking for development and am open to new things. I strive to gain experience and share it with others.

This is a repository I created to showcase my skills and track my progress in data analytics related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I describe the projects with a brief description of the tasks, technologies used and results.

### Analysis of user behavior in a mobile application
**Code**: [user_behavior_mobile_application.ipynb](https://github.com/sokol-kris/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/037264cdc2009357fdc5dfb9eeb77e9077693d04/user_behavior_mobile_application.ipynb)  
**Description**: The dataset contains data on events that took place in the mobile application "Unnecessary things". In it, users sell their unnecessary things by posting them on the bulletin board. It is necessary to conduct an analysis of user behavior based on identifying the main scenarios for using the application for the purpose of further segmentation of users. The customer's further work will consist of testing hypotheses to increase user engagement, improve the functionality of the application and increase conversion to the target action - "contacts show".  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, retention rate, conversion rate, sankey diagram, proportions z-test, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Scipy Stats, Matplotlib, Plotly.  
**Results:** analysis of cohort analysis metrics, identification of user scenarios, hypothesis testing, data-based business recommendations.
