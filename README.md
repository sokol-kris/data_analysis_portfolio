# Kristina Melnikova - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Kristina! I have a technical background and a master's degree in "System Analysis and Management". During my studies, I worked closely with analysis and marketing as a procurement and pricing analyst, but now, thanks to mastering new tools, I am looking for development and am open to new things. I strive to gain experience and share it with others.

This is a repository I created to showcase my skills and track my progress in data analytics related topics.
