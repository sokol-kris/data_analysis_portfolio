# Kristina Melnikova - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Kristina! I have a technical background and a master's degree in "System Analysis and Management". During my studies, I worked closely with analysis and marketing as a procurement and pricing analyst, but now, thanks to mastering new tools, I am looking for development and am open to new things. I strive to gain experience and share it with others.

This is a repository I created to showcase my skills and track my progress in data analytics related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I describe the projects with a brief description of the tasks, technologies used and results.

### Analysis of user behavior in a mobile application

*display of interactive images has been replaced by png format*  
**Code**: [user_behavior_mobile_application.ipynb](https://github.com/sokol-kris/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/037264cdc2009357fdc5dfb9eeb77e9077693d04/user_behavior_mobile_application.ipynb)  
**Description**: The dataset contains data on events that took place in the mobile application "Unnecessary things". In it, users sell their unnecessary things by posting them on the bulletin board. It is necessary to conduct an analysis of user behavior based on identifying the main scenarios for using the application for the purpose of further segmentation of users. The customer's further work will consist of testing hypotheses to increase user engagement, improve the functionality of the application and increase conversion to the target action - "contacts show".  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, retention rate, conversion rate, sankey diagram, proportions z-test, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Scipy Stats, Matplotlib, Plotly.  
**Results:** analysis of cohort analysis metrics, identification of user scenarios, hypothesis testing, data-based business recommendations.

### Research of the Moscow catering market

*displaying interactive images is not available, you can use **nbviewer -> execute on binder***  
**Code**: [research_of_Moscow_catering_establishments.ipynb](https://github.com/sokol-kris/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/research_of_Moscow_catering_establishments.ipynb)  
**Description**: The study presents work with a dataset of Moscow catering establishments, compiled on the basis of data from Yandex Maps and Yandex Business services for the summer of 2022. In this work, I studied the Moscow market, interesting features and presented the results obtained, which in the future will help investors choose a suitable place to open a catering establishment.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization in geoanalytics, presentation.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Folium, Plotly.  
**Results:** anomaly processing, geoanalytics, presentation preparation, data-driven business recommendations.

### Research for a food retail startup

**Code**: [research_for_a_food_retail_startup.ipynb](https://github.com/sokol-kris/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/research_for_a_food_retail_startup.ipynb)  
**Description**: In this work, I study the sales funnel, find out how users reach the purchase. And also examine the results of the A/A/B experiment:
The designers wanted to change the fonts in the entire application, and the managers were afraid that users would be uncomfortable. They agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. The users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control groups with old fonts and one experimental group with new ones.  
**Skills:** data analysis, event analytics, event funnel, A/B testing, proportions z-test.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Scipy Stats, Matplotlib, Plotly.  
**Results:** log event frequency analysis, funnel plotting, statistical test of equality of shares of each group in terms of each funnel event, A/B test results analysis.  

### Entertainmen application analysis

**Code**: [entertainmen application analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/sokol-kris/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/entertainmen_application_analysis.ipynb)  
**Description**: In this project, I analyze why despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the last few months, I analyze when the costs of attracting a client pay off and what factors hinder attracting clients.  
**Skills:** data analysis, calculation and visualization of business metrics (LTV, CAC, ROI, retention rate, conversion rate).  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** user profiles, marketing spend distribution analysis, reasons for user acquisition inefficiency, recommendations for the marketing department.

### Online Store Analysis
**Code**: [online_store_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/sokol-kris/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/online_store_analysis.ipynb)  
**Description**: In this project, I prioritized a prepared list of online store hypotheses to increase revenue, and also analyzed the results of the A/B test.  
**Skills:** data analysis, prioritization of hypotheses ICE/RICE, visualization of cumulative graphs, A/B testing, Mann-Whitney U test.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Scipy Stats, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** anomaly processing, prioritization of hypotheses, testing hypotheses based on A/B test results.
